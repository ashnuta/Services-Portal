Something like this should be top pe our Website banner along with Details like
Costumer help support and mail id and social handles+ usme top right corner mein
profile ka option and use we have to build similar page ss this pic- not exactly
this(hope u"ll get that idea) like km details add kr ke bhi we can do it.


Also top right corner PE ek notification icon. Actually sbse upar ek top banner 
rahega then uske neeche wale strip mein we have to add icons like profile, 
notification search bar, filter button, isme i am doubting one thing like not 
exactly finalized the idea as to how to include the icon in function like Request
a Service/Manage a Service/Request a Product/Provide a Service/Product like isko
alag se dialog box mein include karein ya filter option mein include krein we
have to figure out that what will work for us


After Searching For Product/Service similar drop down list aayegi and user can 
finalize usko kya final krna hai like we will provide the details like email, 
contact number and apply/request/purchase accordingly woh product ya service
 hai and jo post krega service ya product woh details toh put up krega hi toh 
 woh user ko automatically show hongi
